### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by [Kaiqi Wang]

+ Project summary: [The purpose of this project is to analyze the trend of music lyrics in the lyrics data collected from 1970 to 2016. The entire dataset-“lyrics.csv” is a filtered corpus of lyrics from more than 380,000 songs from MetroLyrics. You can read more about it on [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics). For the purpose of this report, I have mined the lyrics data from two aspects, namely the number of songs and the lyrics information. I mainly performed deep mining of song lyrics features in the 2000s where the number of songs surged.] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
